## Blood Lead Levels in NYC Children
### *Hypothesis*\
  "In Boroughs where an increased number of children tested positive for elevated blood lead levels, we anticipate that there will be higher rates of poverty."

## Background\

![Five NYC Boroughs](https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768/upload/c6/23/73/shutterstock-152208935.jpg)

## Methods\
Our dataset provides information about the number of children in New York City that tested with elevated levels of lead in their blood by location and year. 
Every year, all children at the ages of 1 and 2 years old, living in New York City are required to get their blood lead levels tested. If they are at risk for elevated levels, they are tested up until the age of 6. The data is provided to the public by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, through the data.cityofnewyork.us website. The data is sorted by the year and the location, which is broken down into the area name, area ID, geography type (borough, citywide, or neighborhood), and the borough ID. The variables are broken up into columns displaying the number of children that tested within certain blood lead level ranges, measured in micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL).

Our tables show that out hypothesis was not entirely correct, we anticipated that the boroughs with the most rates of poverty would also have the highest rates of elevated Blood Lead Levels in Chidren. Instead, we found that there does seem to be some correlation between poverty rates and percent of positive tests per borough. Staten Island and Manhattan have consistently had the lowest levels of Evelvated Blood Lead levels as well as the lowest rates of poverty. Vice verca, Brooklyn and the Bronx have had the highest rates of poverty and positive tests, potentially indicating a positive relationship between poverty level and positive tests. 


## Data Dictionary 
'geo_type': <chr> the type of geographic region (borough, citywide, or neighborhood).
'geo_area_id': <num> each area is given a unique ID number, with boroughs being given numbers 1-5, while neighborhoods are given 3 digit numbers, with their first number being correlated with the ID of the borough they are in.
'geo_area_name': <chr> the name of the borough, city, or neighborhood respectively.
'borough_id': <num> the same as the ID number given to the boroughs in geo_area_id. This column gives every neighborhood the ID of the borough its located in.
'Year': <num> the year that the test data in the row is from. The years range from 2005-2016.
'Poverty_Rate': <num> The poverty rate of the borough in the given year.
'BLL_5': <num> the number of children in that year that tested as having a Blood Lead Level of equal to or over 5 micrograms per deciliter.
'BLL_10': <num> the number of children in that year that tested as having a Blood Lead Level of equal to or over 10 micrograms per deciliter.
'BLL_15': <num> the number of children in that year that tested as having a Blood Lead Level of equal to or over 15 micrograms per deciliter.
'Total_Test': <num> the total number of children that were tested in that area and that year.
'BLL_5_ratio': <num> the ratio describing the number of children that tested with a Blood Lead Level of equal to or over 5 micrograms per deciliter over total children tested that year.
'BLL_10_ratio': <num> the ratio describing the number of children that tested with a Blood Lead Level of equal to or over 10 micrograms per deciliter over total children tested that year.
'BLL_15_ratio': <num> the ratio describing the number of children that tested with a Blood Lead Level of equal to or over 15 micrograms per deciliter over total children tested that year.
'Total_Lead_Poisoned': <num> the combined number of children who tested positive for elevated blood lead levels. BLL_5 + BLL_10 + BLL_15 = Total_Lead_Poisoned.
'Total_Not_Lead_Poisoned': <num> the combined number of children who tested negative for elevated blood lead levels. Total_Test – Total_Lead_Poisoned = Total_Not_Lead_Poisoned.
'Pos_Test_Rate': <num> the percentage of children that tested positive out of the total number of children tested.
